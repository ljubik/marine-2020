                    <p class="first-txt first-let">The American shipbuilding scene, fi lled with participants constructing all manner of vessels, has been
navigating through stormy times (lately, yards
along the Gulf Coast have literally been dealing
with storms). The orders for newbuild, repair and conversion projects continue to fl ow in—albeit at a reduced
pace—and the boats and ships go down the ways into the
water, but the overall panorama has seen tremendous sea
changes as the business has shifted.
Maritime businesses worldwide have been grappling
with currents both internal and external. Across the entire landscape in 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has
brought about operational changes that will continue into
the future, long after Americans are vaccinated. Most U.S.
shipyards were identifi ed early on as “essential businesses”,
and therefore continued working throughout 2020. The
proactive attitude of one yard during 2020’s pandemic
did not go unnoticed, with Fincantieri Bay Shipbuilding
(FBS) receiving the Northeast Wisconsin Service Award.
As explained in a press release from FBS, “The award honors the unsung heroes of the coronavirus who helped keep
Wisconsin moving while the state was shut down. Honorees are selected for going above and beyond the call of duty
in their respective fi elds or industries.”
Throughout the maritime world, again refl ecting broader trends, talk has turned to “decarbonization” (with re

                    duced CO2 going beyond notions of simply improving
vessel effi ciency), which will have profound implications
for vessel propulsion and fuel choices. Initially, this trend
has driven a movement toward liquefi ed natural gas (LNG)
fueled propulsion. In Pascagoula, Miss., the Halter Marine
yard will soon be completing the tug barge combination
Q-Ocean Service / Q-LNG 4000, for Q-LNG. The 4,000
cubic meter unit will be contracted to Shell, and will be
handling both ship-to-ship and ship-to-shore transfers of
LNG to vessels and to shoreside LNG distribution depots.
Indicative of the currents, FBS, in Sturgeon Bay, Wis.,
held a modern day “keel laying ceremony” (with pre-constructed modules laid in place), in late June, for an LNG
bunker barge, Clean Canaveral, that will provide fuel to
shipping customers of NorthStar Midstream (tied to private investor Oaktree Capital), along the U.S. East Coast,
out of Jacksonville. The 5,400 cubic meter articulated tug
barge (ATB) unit will be owned by a new entity, Polaris
New Energy, which has options on two additional units.
With its Great Lakes location, FBS is also building a
28,000 dwt. self unloading bulk carrier for Interlake
Steamship, and delivered the dry bulk barge Michigan
Trader to Van Enkevort Tug and Barge in August.
Along the Gulf Coast, Eastern Shipbuilding- Panama
City, Fla. has also been active in multiple segments. The
yard is in the midst of a three-vessel order for New York
City’s Staten Island Ferry. The fi rst of the 4,500-passenger
trio, Sgt Michael Ollis, is set to be delivered in late 2020
(after being delayed due to Hurricane Michael in 2018),
with a second vessel, Sandy Ground, launched in June
2020. The yard has continued to work, in the midst of
the pandemic and an active hurricane season. In August,
Eastern, which had previously been a prodigious producer
of tugboats, delivered the 5,100 hp Z-drive ship-handling
tug A. Thomas Higgins to E.N. Bisso (following up on a
sister vessel C.D. White delivered earlier in the year).
Also in the Gulf, the Metal Shark facilities, encompassing three locations in Louisiana and Alabama, have been
active, with a varied construction slate. The Bayou La Batre, Ala. facility (previously the Horizon Shipyard) recently
delivered a 6,000 hp boat to Florida Marine Transporters (FMT), the fi rst of a three boat order, and the yard’s
fi rst towboat for the inland marketplace. The Metal Shark
yards have also continued to deliver ferries to NYC Ferry
(in New York) and to Potomac Water Taxi, in the Washington, D.C. area. Metal Shark, also a prolifi c builder of
fast boats for law enforcement and for military users, credits “series production” to its ability to deliver vessels rapidly
and at scale, at a time that cities such as New York seek to

                        A different sort of environmental theme (against a backdrop of increased funding for dredging) is evidenced most
                        recently with Eastern Shipbuilding beginning construction

                        Corporation. And the Keppel AmFELS yard at Brownsville, Texas announced an order for a 15,000-cubic-yard
                        hopper dredge, to be delivered in 2023 to Manson Construction. The yard (historically a builder of jack-up rigs) is

                        However, weak demand on the commercial side (energy

                            between project developers and U.S. owners regarding installation vessels. Matt Tremblay, ABS Senior Vice President, Global Offshore, told Marine News, “ABS is involved
                            in a range of projects to support the development of the
                            U.S. offshore wind industry, including providing services

                            He added, “As the industry and the turbines continue to
                            grow in size and complexity, the vessels needed to install
                            them in U.S. waters will need to be built, and we are seeing

                the type of tug required by Vane Brothers. I need to be certain they can build the design to our specifi cations,
                deliver it in a timely manner, and bring it in at our budgeted cost.”
                Recent Vane newbuilds have included three Assateague class ATBs (built at Conrad Shipyards with 4,400
                bhp tugs coupled to 80,000 bbl barges) and two Salisbury class push boats (3,000 bhp), suitable for the inland
                rivers. Two more of the push boats are under construction, at Chesapeake Shipbuilding (which has also carved
                out a niche in building small river cruise vessels for American Cruise Lines).
                Capt. Demsky continued, “If the yard has been building tugs for many years, there is a good chance I have
                been aboard some of their tugs or designs. I would already have a good idea of what I like about their builds,
                their strengths and weaknesses, and what the yard can provide to ensure that new Vane vessels maximize
                safety, performance and crew comfort.”
                Vane Brothers takes a hands-on approach, with Capt. Demsky telling Marine News, “I like to walk the yard and
                talk with management and supervisors to get a feel for the knowledge and expertise they offer. The rapport we
                are able to build is always important, since I will be interacting with yard personnel on a nearly daily basis for
                the length of the project. During the walk, I also look to see whether the yard is well kept and effi ciently laid out.
                If the yard is clean and organized, I feel better about entrusting them with a Vane Brothers project.

                    <p class="first-txt">Tremblay explained further, “At the end of 2019 ABS
                        granted VARD the fi rst Approval in Principle (AIP) for a
                        Jones Act service operations vessel (SOV), with primary
                        functions including accommodation, transferring technicians to installations as well as storing spare parts and tools
                        for operations in U.S. offshore wind farms. That milestone
                        has been followed by further AIPs both to VARD for a
                        large SOV and to BAR and Chartwell Marine for an innovative Jones Act crew transfer vessel.”
                        Tremblay pointed to the class society’s prominent role in
                        wind energy’s buildout, evolving analogously to offshore
                        oil drilling towards fl oating units. “ABS provides leading
                        classifi cation services for wind support vessels, including
                        self-elevating units, wind turbine installations vessels and
                        offshore support vessels. ABS classed the largest wind farm
                        installation jack-up Seajacks Scylla in 2015 and earlier this
                        year, to the fi rst fl oating heavy lift installation vessel to be
                        built in Taiwan, Green Jade. ABS is also a world leader in
                        classing fl oating offshore wind, in process of classing nearly
                        80 megawatts of fl oating wind.”</p>
